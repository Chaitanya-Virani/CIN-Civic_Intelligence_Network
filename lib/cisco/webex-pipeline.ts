/**
 * lib/cisco/webex-pipeline.ts
 *
 * The "your way" Webex integration: when a proposal's REAL vote count
 * (votes actually cast through this app — not the seed baseline used for
 * the demo tally numbers) crosses a threshold, CIN:
 *
 *   1. creates a brand-new Webex space via the Rooms API,
 *   2. adds the configured moderator email(s) (WEBEX_NOTIFY_EMAILS) as
 *      members, so the space shows up in *their* Webex account — not just
 *      the bot's — the moment it's created,
 *   3. posts the proposal into it (with a link back to CIN) plus the same
 *      Adaptive Card ballot the inbound flow uses, so the conversation can
 *      continue in Webex,
 *   4. advances the proposal to the "trigger" pipeline stage — this *is*
 *     "Trigger to Action: routed to the body that can act" (see
 *     lib/pipeline.ts) — the Webex room is that routing.
 *
 * This is idempotent: a proposal only ever gets one room
 * (proposals.webex_room_id is unique), so re-checking on every vote is
 * safe and cheap.
